# Scrum -- Basics

- Scrum is a project development process based on Sprints. This tool is so powerful because it focus on execution, on minimizing all the surprises and as a result, generates a higher quality code.

Some tips for teams that are starting to use *Scrum*:
- Don't take too long in meetings, making them if it's possible on Monday, avoiding possible dispersion of the weekend.  
	- Questions to be made on this meeting:
		- What can we deliver to meet our goal?
		- How will we deliver that work?

**Sprint** -> small challenges presented to the group during the weekly/daily meeting.

*Sprint* creation process:

- Spring planning.
- Daily scrum or standup.
- Sprint reviews.
- Sprint retrospectives.

What are the roles during a Scrum process?

- **Scrum master** is the organizer of the project, leading all the teams to achieve their weekly goal;
- **Scrum developing team** are the ones that meet the daily/week goals;
- **Project manager** is the leader,  he is responsible to take decisions, he checks the deadlines and ensures that the project is within the requirements. 

During the solving of *Sprints*, the dev teams will be producing three artifacts: the product backlog, sprint backlog and increment. 

- First you'll have the **Project Backlog**,  that master the TODO lists, features and requirements and fixes. Who takes care about this part of the project is the *Project Owner*.
- **Increment** is the last goal to be achieved, being the usable part for the project.
